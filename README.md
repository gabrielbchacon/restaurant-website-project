# Coding a restaurant website (responsive) 

The idea of this excercise is the use all the HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap skills that I acquired in the course ([HTML, CSS, e Javascript para desenvolvedores we](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers?)b) to created a real website that is responsive for all devices. 
It is a very simple layout and also kind of antique, but it was very interesting to code it by the starch for the first time.
